But, the budget was planned with a rate of $0.5 per ADA; so we can currently secure more USDM with less ADA, which de-risk the devaluation of the budget due to price fluctuations. The swap order is parameterized with an owner script which enforces the same permissions as the 'disburse' operation (3 out of 4 signatures).\n\nThe final destination for the swap is the (marketing) treasury itself."
