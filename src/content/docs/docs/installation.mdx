## Installation

<TabItem label="downloads">
The easiest to get started with Amaru is by downloading one of the pre-compiled executable.

<TabItem label="from sources">
If you rather install everything from sources, no worries: Amaru comes with a rich [`Makefile`](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru/tree/main/Makefile) to assist with compilation.

```console
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru.git
cd amaru
make
```

You'll see an extensive help menu listing the available recipes. To simply build Amaru, run:

```console
make build
```

## Quick Start

<Steps>

1. ### Bootstrap the node

   Amaru requires snapshots to start as it doesn't re-validate historical data.

   ```console
   amaru bootstrap --network=preprod
   ```

   This command downloads pre-packed snapshots for Amaru, and import them into Amaru's local storage.

2. ### (Optional) Setup observability backends

   Amaru doesn't have a graphical user interface out of the box, but it has
   telemetry. So, in addition to logs printed out on the terminal, you can run
   one an observability backend to collect and process the telemetry.

   ```console
   docker-compose -f monitoring/jaeger/docker-compose.yml up
   export AMARU_WITH_OPEN_TELEMETRY=true
   ```

   This is only one example, you can also look into [Amaru-doctor](https://github.com/jeluard/amaru-doctor.git) as a lean alternative.

3. ### Run Amaru

   Then simply run the Amaru daemon. This assumes a local peer on
   `127.0.0.1:3001` but you can put any valid peer address here. You can also
   repeat the `--peer` option should you want to add multiple peers.

   ```console
   amaru daemon --network=preprod --peer-address 127.0.0.1:3001
   ```

   This will run Amaru from the snapshot onwards. You can interrupt it at any
   time using a SIGINT (Ctrl+C). It'll resume back to where it was on restart.

</Steps>

<Aside type="note">
These instructions assume one starts from scratch, and has access to another peer on the selected network (e.g. [`preprod`](https://book.world.dev.cardano.org/env-preprod.html)).

To run a local cardano-node as a peer, refer to [Cardano's developers portal](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/get-started/cardano-node/running-cardano). Make sure your peer listens to port `3001` or adapt the `AMARU_PEER_ADDRESS` option or environment variable (e.g. `export AMARU_PEER_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1:3002`)
